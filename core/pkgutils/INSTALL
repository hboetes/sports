First of all, you have to unpack the cruxports_for_openbsd.tar.gz
tarball in /

    sudo tar xzf cruxports_for_openbsd.tar.gz -C /


After that you can build and install pkgutils with the ./bootstrap
script.

    cd /usr/cruxports/core/pkgutils
    ./bootstrap


After running ./bootstrap I recommend you install the prt-get
port.

    cd /usr/cruxports/core/prt-get
    pkgmk -i


And then all the other ports in the core directory but first the
bzip2 and m4 package. You can safely ignore warnings from prt-get
about missing directories. We'll fix that later on.

    cd /usr/cruxports/core/
    prt-get install bzip2 m4 *


And after installing the ports port you can fetch the whole
ports-tree with:

    ports -u


And now you can install vorbis-tools like this:

    prt-get deptree vorbis-tools
    prt-get depinst vorbis-tools


BTW this is what I have in my sudoers file.  Use visudo(8) to get
it there.
