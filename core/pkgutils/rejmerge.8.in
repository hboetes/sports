.SH NAME
rejmerge \- merge files that were rejected during package upgrades
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBrejmerge [options]\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBrejmerge\fP is a \fIpackage management\fP utility that helps you merge files that were rejected
during package upgrades. For each rejected file found in \fI/var/package/rejecs/\fP, \fBrejmerge\fP
will display the difference between the installed version and the rejected version. The user can then
choose to keep the installed version, upgrade to the rejected version or perform a merge of the two.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B "\-r, \-\-root <path>"
Specify alternative root (default is "/"). This should be used
if you want to merge rejected files on a temporary mounted partition,
which is "owned" by another system.
.TP
.B "\-v, \-\-version"
Print version and exit.
.TP
.B "\-h, \-\-help"
Print help and exit.
.SH CONFIGURATION
When \fBrejmerge\fP is started it will source \fI/etc/rejmerge.conf\fP.
This file can be used to alter the way \fBrejmerge\fP displays file differences and performs file
merges. Changing the default behaviour is done by re-defining the shell functions \fBrejmerge_diff()\fP
and/or \fBrejmerge_merge()\fP.
.TP
.B rejmerge_diff()
This function is executed once for each rejected file. Arguments \fB$1\fP and \fB$2\fP contain the paths
to the installed and rejected files. Argument \fB$3\fP contains the path to a temporary file where this
function should write its result. The contents of the temporary file will later be presented to the user
as the difference between the two files.
.TP
.B rejmerge_merge()
This function is executed when the user chooses to merge two
files. Arguments \fB$1\fP and \fB$2\fP contain the paths to the
installed and rejected files. Argument \fB$3\fP contains the path
to a temporary file where this function should write its
result. The contents of the temporary file will later be presented
to the user as the merge result.
This function also has the option to set the variable
\fB$REJMERGE_MERGE_INFO\fP. The contents of this variable will be
displayed as informational text after a merge has been
performed. Its purpose is to provide information about the merge,
e.g. "5 merge conflicts found".
