.SH NAME
pkgmk \- make software package
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpkgmk [options]\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpkgmk\fP is a \fIpackage management\fP utility, which makes
a software package. A \fIpackage\fP is an archive of files (.pkg.tar.gz)
that can be installed using pkgadd(8).

To prepare to use pkgmk, you must write a file named \fIPkgfile\fP
that describes how the package should be build. Once a suitable
\fIPkgfile\fP file exists, each time you change some source files,
you simply execute pkgmk to bring the package up to date. The pkgmk
program uses the \fIPkgfile\fP file and the last-modification
times of the source files to decide if the package needs to be updated.

Global build configuration is stored in \fI/etc/pkgmk.conf\fP. This
file is read by pkgmk at startup.
